# Client Storage

*Highly inspired by AE2 ... but clientside!*

A **clientside** mod (yes you can use it on any server,
though anticheats might interfer) to never search
for an item again!

Having a chestmonster? You'll be able to deal with it
easily!

### Features
* see all items in chests that are in your reach proximity
* any resourcepack support (gui is made out of creative textures)
* pick up items seamlessly
* search for items via built-in searchbox
    * `#` for tags (e. g. `#protection` - will search for any items having `protection` tag) 
    * `@` for modded items (e. g. `@simplevillagers` - will search for items from `simplevillagers` mod)
* ~~put items back in (todo)~~

## Contributions

Well, I must admit, code is kinda
cursed & messy, not to mention optimization
that could be done ... You've been warned :wink:.
